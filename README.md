# UCSC Coursework

#### I am passionate about using programming and data analysis to make a better life for others. To enhance my skills, I pick topics from Kaggle and also collect datas on my own to practice data science in Python & R.

*This repository is the collection of course work in UCSC Silicon Valley Extension. You are welcome to check out my side projects and course work in following repositories:*
